## Java 8 practice

### How to run the project
In cmd run following:

> mvnw.cmd clean install

In bash run following:

> ./mvnw clean install
 
### Conditions
- Initially all tests will fail.
- Analyze `UserService` java doc and methods definitions.
- Analyze tests (prepared data, actual action (method call) and expected result).
- Do not change data model and tests.
- Implement all methods from `UserServiceImpl` using Java 8 features (lambda, StreamAPI, etc).
- Run project as described [here](#how-to-run-the-project). All tests should pass.
